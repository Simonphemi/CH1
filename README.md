## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Analysis was performed by comparing the data of the Outcomes against Launch-dates of the Theatre category. As that would be a good indicator of how invested people were at the initial date of release. The outcomes and launch dates were displayed on a line chart to show how effective each category was on different dates through the years 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
analysis was done on the Percentage of outcomes in relation with the expected goal of the pledged amount from investors. A line chart was also created for this analysis to give a visual representation.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
